Here's your full Phases 1-5 implementation for the equity query engine:
What You Get:
🏗️ Phase 1 (Foundation):

SchemaManager - Handles database schema documentation
BusinessContextManager - Manages domain knowledge and entity definitions

⚙️ Phase 2 (Core Logic):

BusinessRulesManager - Complete rule engine with vocabulary mappings
GenerationRulesManager - SQL generation guidelines and best practices

🧠 Phase 3 (Intelligence):

EntityDiscovery - Handles data variations ("US" → ["USA", "United States"])
DateProcessor - Resolves complex dates (fiscal quarters, business logic)

🚀 Phase 4 (Optimization):

QueryPatterns - Common SQL templates library
JOIN optimization integrated into rules engine

🔗 Phase 5 (Integration):

PromptManager - Assembles all components into complete prompts
EquityQueryProcessor - Main orchestrator that coordinates everything

Ready-to-Use Features:
✅ Business vocabulary mapping - "officers" → employee_type IN (...)
✅ Entity discovery - "US" finds all database variations automatically
✅ Fiscal calendar aware - "Q4" respects company's fiscal year
✅ Compliance rules - 10b5-1 plans, blackout periods, etc.
✅ Performance optimization - Smart JOIN requirements, caching
✅ Configuration driven - Update rules without code changes
✅ Production ready - Docker, testing, comprehensive logging
Quick Start:
bash# 1. Setup
python scripts/setup.py
cp .env.example .env

# 2. Install 
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run
python -c "
import asyncio
from src.equity_query_engine.core.equity_query_processor import EquityQueryProcessor

async def test():
    processor = EquityQueryProcessor()
    result = await processor.process_query(
        'Show officers with 10b5-1 plans in Q4 by US region',
        'CREATE TABLE participants.participant_detail...'
    )
    print(result['sql'])

asyncio.run(test())
"
Team Distribution Ready:
Each component maps to the team breakdown we discussed:

Database Architect → SchemaManager
Business Analyst → BusinessContextManager
Senior Developer → BusinessRulesManager
ML Engineer → EntityDiscovery
Domain Expert → DateProcessor
Technical Lead → PromptManager integration

You now have a complete, production-ready equity query engine that transforms natural language into accurate SQL using GPT-4o with comprehensive business intelligence! 🚀RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
